    </header><p>This is probably the coolest thing I’ve learnt this week. I stumbled across this through a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/">Reddit post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Is it just me or sometimes when you are looking at the same word/words for a long time does it ever occur to you that “hey this word doesn’t look like it should be spelled like that”, but you know 100% that it’s correct?
</blockquote>
<figcaption>—Poor guy on Reddit</figcaption>
<p>Turns out this very strange phenomenon called semantic satiation. What’s interesting is that I think I used to encounter this more often at a younger age, rather than now. I suppose that’s a good thing—I don’t want to get confused after staring at a word for long periods of time. Or perhaps I am just making up silly shit.</p>
<p>Either way, poor type designers. Their eyes must be permanently depressed with seeing 6s and 9s to the point that they change from numbers to something a little more inappropriate… Yikes!</p>
