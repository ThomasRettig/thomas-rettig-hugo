This is probably the coolest thing I’ve learnt this week. I stumbled across this through a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/):

<blockquote>Is it just me or sometimes when you are looking at the same word/words for a long time does it ever occur to you that “hey this word doesn’t look like it should be spelled like that”, but you know 100% that it’s correct?
</blockquote>

Turns out this very strange phenomenon called semantic satiation. What’s interesting is that I think I used to encounter this more often at a younger age, rather than now. I suppose that’s a good thing—I don’t want to get confused after staring at a word for long periods of time.

Poor type designers too.
