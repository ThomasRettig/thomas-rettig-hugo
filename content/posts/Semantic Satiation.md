This is probably the coolest thing I’ve learnt this week. I stumbled across this through a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/):

<blockquote>Is it just me or sometimes when you are looking at the same word/words for a long time does it ever occur to you that “hey this word doesn’t look like it should be spelled like that”, but you know 100% that it’s correct?
</blockquote>

Turns out this very strange phenomenon called semantic satiation. What’s interesting is that I think I used to encounter this more often at a younger age, rather than now. I suppose that’s a good thing—I don’t want to get confused after staring at a word for long periods of time. Or perhaps I am just making up silly shit.

Either way, poor type designers. Their eyes must be permanently depressed with seeing 6s and 9s to the point that they change from numbers to something a little more inappropriate… Yikes!
