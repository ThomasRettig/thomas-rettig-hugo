[Cleanup.pictures](https://cleanup.pictures/) does exactly what it does: It cleans up pictures. You draw over areas of an image and it automagically removes that part. Yes, it’s like Photoshop’s spot healing brush tool, except that it’s a website and it’s free. And unlike primitive spot healing tools which rely on surroundings to “import” textures, Cleanup.pictures uses artificial intelligence. The science is complex; it’s built using artificial intelligence and some weird science. The website is a direct implementation of this [scientific paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07161.pdf), and is created by [Cyril Diagne](https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne).

Here’s an example from their [Github repo](https://saic-mdal.github.io/lama-project/):

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senya-ashukha/senya-ashukha.github.io/master/projects/lama_21/ezgif-4-0db51df695a8.gif" title="Sample Image—Nature" caption="A before-after comparison." >}}

That was spooky, wasn’t it? I was a bit sceptical, so I tried it out myself just for good measure:

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinary-sucks-so-fucking-much/image/upload/v1636704470/cleanup-test.webp" title="Before and after comparison" >}}

Rad! Not to mention, [Cleanup.pictures](https://cleanup.pictures/) has a really nice *how-did-they-snag-that-url* domain, just like [remove.bg](https://remove.bg/) and [clipdrop.co](https://clipdrop.co/).
